Over the centuries since Shakespeare, music has continued to be an indispensable aspect of our daily life.Not a day passes by without you humming a tune or listening to one.Our sources of listening to them have also evolved over time. From the vintage gramaphones through mix tapes through radio, our listening medium has now reached online music-streaming platforms. Spotify, Apple music, Google play etc are some of the most popular of these.

With over 36% market share among online music subscribers and having a base of over 100 million subscribers, Spotify occupies the top spot. As a music afficionado, this prompted me to dig deeper in to the spotify songs database to discover interesting trends regarding the songs, their artists and hopefully help people discover new music.

NoSQL Outstanding Music Elaboration (**NOME**) is a website in which you can find new tracks, new albums and new genres based on your favorite songs!
